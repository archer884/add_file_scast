# add_file screencast
... I don't know what this program does, really.

No, seriously, I think it multiplies some value by all the numbers it finds in a file and then prints the sum of the results. Anyway, moving along... >.>

The idea behind this video is to demonstrate `map()` and `and_then()`, two fine members of the twin `Result` and `Option` APIs. They perform much the same role, but they have very different ergonomics, and they can be a little tricky to use until you understand the difference. I figured I'd make a video about it because, of course, it took me awhile to grok it. :)
